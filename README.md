# Greatfet-Erica
A yet non-offical neighbor for the GreatFET One targeting the 433/868/915MHz bands
# Name
The plant erica reminds a bit to antennas. And that is what Erica shall be about. A neighbor with 4 antennas.
# Purpose
Primary purpose of this neighbor is to provide a possibility to do security research within the 433MHz/868MHz/915MHz band. Idea is to have in total 4 CC1101 transceivers available. Two tuned for 433MHz band, one for 868MHz(still allowing to monitor 915MHz band), one for 915MHz band(still allowing to monitor 868MHz band).
# PoC
A first version is under development that is build with pre-build, low cost CC1101 transceivers. 

THE PURPOSE OF THIS NEIGHBOR IS NOT TO BE A TOOL FOR CRIMINALS!
